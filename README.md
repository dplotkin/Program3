Write-Ups:
Fewest Hops: The Fewest Hops Algorithim will be use a shortest-path algorithim. We will use Dijkstra's algorithim to solve this problem. The weight of each edge will be 1 though, so the fewest hops can be stored and using the earliest possible edge. Dijkstra's algorithim will produce a shortest path graph. 

Timeline:
Sunday (12/7): Have algorithims finished?
Monday (12/8): Meetup after class to plan for presentation.
Tusday (12/9): Presentation in lab
